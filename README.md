# hello-world
my first project. I want to learn bots.

Hi my name is Jeff. 

Im new to this but i have always liked computers and want to step it up a notch. I work for a company called Fittrax meals. I am part of a team dedicated to helping people eat better with all organic, local sourced and market value priced product. Im a getting on the job trained in the tech field which is how i ended up here. I found out about slack and wanted to incorparte Hubot into slack and found out i was in over my head with information. I attend Colorado Tech taking a cyber security degree! when i first started it was my foot in the door. Im pretty bad at school because i have a hard time sticking with things im not interested in or don't think are relative. Realizing the tool i had on the internet mixed with motivation i could learn anything i actually wanted to learn! I have been changing my life around and its important to me to have goals and succeed! Im trying to learn how Hubot is created and i can incorparte into Fittrax to to reach higher and long term goals
